Based on the <a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aws-vpn-tab-closer/eeohkjpjmohadfbgaghdofdphnjhidfg\">Chrome extension</a> by the same name.\n\nWhen the AWS VPN clients resubmits your stored credentials it leaves a very annoying tab open in your browser, if you are AFK for a while you can come back to a window full of tabs.\n\nThis extension will only activate for tabs using the URL http://127.0.0.1:35001 and it will close it as soon as the confirmation message is displayed. This will not affect the sign in process."
